URL Converter HTTP API

There could be the following two options for the solution of the given problem

Option 1 : Using pre defined algorithm

	Without using any database convert the URLs using a pre defined algorithm and get the Long/Short URLs.

Option 2 : Using the Database Primary Unique Key

	With using database insert primary key and giving the base64 conversion as short URL.

Reasons for choosing Option 2:

	1. An alogithm could take more time and processing
	2. Database key would be unique everytime and so would be the base64 conversion

Both the processes (Short->Long and Long->Short) are POST requests as POST requests are better since the data is to be sent in JSON format.
